                Hi! <br>

                My story began more than 1 year ago when I realized that I wanted to try myself in web development. 
                So, I started learning <span>JavaScript</span>. Sometimes it was difficult, but very interesting. Then I start 
                learning <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. I remembered all the sites I've ever seen and analyzed how they were created.
                After HTML and CSS, I started trying to create something on my own. I was looking for tutorials 
                where people created a beautiful project and repeated after them, or I got some details to use 
                it in my own project. <br> <br>
                
                So, I created ====================. <br> <br>
                
                I added JavaScript to make the pages more dynamic.  <br> <br>
                
                In the project ===========. <br> <br>
                
                Then I realized that I needed to learn <span>React</span> and <span>Redux</span> in order to create a more powerful, 
                beautiful and more quickly created projects. <br> <br>
                
                In the project ======. <br> <br>
                
                While studying web development, I also realized that it is important to understand how a 
                <span>database</span> works, so I tried to create a simple database. <br> <br>
                Also, it is very important that the project works correctly, so I tried <span>CI/CD</span> in my 
                test project. ========. <br> <br>

                Finally, I like to add small details to my project, created by myself. It can be a small simple favicon 
                or a cursor change, if the project has its own atmosphere or vibe, and this will help create a special 
                feeling when visiting the site.
